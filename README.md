# OSINT tool for rust

This is a tool for OSINT operations on Instagram.

## Current Features:
- face detection, extraction and recognition + functionality to build a face recognition database on the fly
- [tui](https://docs.rs/tui/latest/tui/) based cli application
- instagram api

This tool is not in a state where it could be used for actual OSINT work. You would need to modify some code to get the information you want. <br />
Contributing is highly encouraged.
